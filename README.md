# MachineLearning
A repository of my machine learning algorithms.

The algorithms directory contains several machine learning algorithms classes, which can be imported and used on real datasets.

The data directory contains several datasets used in our examples.

The examples directory contains the examples of how to use classes from algorithms.

The functions directory contains several helper functions for algorithms, such as cost and normalization functions, as well as some parameters used in algorithm training.

The preprocessing directory contains some scripts used to process and load data from datasets.
